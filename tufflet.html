        <p>Tufflet is an online quiz system created for anyone who would like to test and track their knowledge of file system and database related concepts. In terms of functionality, it includes a user authentication system with secure hashed passwords, allowing them to store their scores for future tracking. 
            The application quizzes users with five random multiple choice questions fetched from the database, and then displays the latest score result whilst tracking the user’s total average scores across all attempts. The user is then prompted to either try again or securely log out, ensuring a smooth user experience throughout.  It’s a scalable project that allows for easy additions of new questions and topics that uses HTML/CSS for the front end, PHP for the back end, and MySQL for the database.
