In order to run this project, simply start from the index.html file, which is the home page. From there, you're able to navigate to four different tabs, which are labeled 
projects, skills, about, and contact. In the projects tab, you're able to access links to the documentation. In the contact tab, there is also a link for my GitHub. Thank you for visiting!
